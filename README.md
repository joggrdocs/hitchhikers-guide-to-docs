## Note to the Reader

This guide is intentionally written in the style of **Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy** primarily because documentation, and especiallly documenation used to guide you on how to read and write better documenation... can be **overwhelmingly** boring. 

Our hope is that you enjoy reading this guide and that you benefit so much from these divine words of wisdom that you decide to fork it & use it with-in your organization... 🐟 and all!
